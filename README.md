# Nonlinear-Beam-Cylinder-System-Controller
This repository features a MATLAB-based discrete PID controller for a nonlinear beam-cylinder system, developed for an Automatic Control course. The project focuses on achieving zero steady-state error through trial and error. It includes a detailed report and code, all in Spanish, with analysis, assumptions, results, and conclusions.
